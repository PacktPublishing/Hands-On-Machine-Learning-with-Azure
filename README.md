**Build powerful models with cognitive machine learning and artificial intelligence**

## What is this book about?
Implementing Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the cloud had not been possible earlier due to the lack of processing power and storage. However, Azure has created ML and AI services that are easy to implement in the cloud. Hands-On Machine Learning with Azure teaches you how to perform advanced ML projects in the cloud in a cost-effective way.
The book begins by covering the benefits of ML and AI in the cloud. You will then explore Microsoft’s Team Data Science Process to establish a repeatable process for successful AI development and implementation. You will also gain an understanding of AI technologies available in Azure and the Cognitive Services APIs to integrate them into bot applications. This book lets you explore prebuilt templates with Azure Machine Learning Studio and build a model using canned algorithms that can be deployed as web services. The book then takes you through a preconfigured series of virtual machines in Azure targeted at AI development scenarios. You will get to grips with the ML Server and its capabilities in SQL and HDInsight. In the concluding chapters, you’ll integrate patterns with other non-AI services in Azure.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Discover the benefits of leveraging the cloud for ML and AI
* Use Cognitive Services APIs to build intelligent bots
* Build a model using canned algorithms from Microsoft and deploy it as a web service
* Deploy virtual machines in AI development scenarios
* Apply R, Python, SQL Server, and Spark in Azure

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
vision_base_url = "https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0/"

vision_analyze_url = vision_base_url + "analyze"
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

If you are a data scientist or developer familiar with Azure ML and cognitive services and want to create smart models and make sense of data in the cloud, this book is for you. You’ll also find this book useful if you want to bring powerful machine learning services into your cloud applications. Some experience with data manipulation and processing, using languages like SQL, Python, and R, will aid in understanding the concepts covered in this book
